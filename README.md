# MNIST-Handwritten-digit-classification
<h3>Using Python and CNN to take 28 x 28 pixels MNIST images and classify them into digits from 0-9 with the help of Tensorflow.</h3>
<h3>Libraries Required:<br/></h3>
• Tensorflow <br/>
• Matplotlib<br/>
• Numpy<br/>
<br/>
A python program which takes input of 28 x 28 pixels images from MNIST dataset of around 60000 images and trains and classifies them using Tensorflow and sequential model of Keras.
The images are visualized using matplotlib library's argmax function. 
The function simply averages the values of 784 neurons of the array of the image and vizualizes it. It was performed on Jupyter Notebook and the corresponding ipynb file is attached as well.
